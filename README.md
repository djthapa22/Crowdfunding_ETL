# Crowdfunding_ETL:  Mini Project on Extraction, Transformation and Loading

**Overview:**

Within this assignment, we were tasked with using Pandas in unpacking data via excel or csv to create dataframes to run the analysis on the following asks:

<ins> Requirements: </ins>
* **Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames**
* **Create the Campaign DataFrame**
* **Create the Contacts DataFrame**
* **Create the Crowdfunding Database**

<ins> Findings: </ins>

Throughout this project, we further enhanced our dataframe creation skills by leveraging functions such as split, "pd.to_datetime", and more in order to refine and segment data for more optimal analysis. We further synthesized our saved csv files in order to create a sql schema, by creating tables in order to create meaningful query enhancements.
